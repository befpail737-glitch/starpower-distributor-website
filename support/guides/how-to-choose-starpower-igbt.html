                <p class="lead">Selecting the right IGBT module is critical for the performance, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of your power electronics project. As a leading <strong>Starpower distributor</strong>, we've helped hundreds of engineers navigate this process. This guide breaks it down into three simple steps.</p>

                <h2>Step 1: Define Your Application's Key Electrical Parameters</h2>
                <p>Before looking at any datasheets, you must first define your system's requirements. The two most important parameters are:</p>
                <h3>A. Blocking Voltage (Vces)</h3>
                <p>The IGBT's voltage rating must be higher than the maximum DC bus voltage it will experience. A safety margin is crucial. A common rule of thumb is to select an IGBT with a Vces rating that is at least 1.5 to 2 times the nominal DC bus voltage.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>400V AC System:</strong> DC Bus ≈ 560V. Choose a <strong>1200V</strong> IGBT module.</li>
                    <li><strong>230V AC System:</strong> DC Bus ≈ 320V. Choose a <strong>600V or 650V</strong> IGBT module.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>B. RMS and Peak Current (Ic)</h3>
                <p>You need to calculate the maximum continuous RMS current and the peak repetitive current your load will draw. Select a module where its rated continuous collector current (Ic) at your expected case temperature (e.g., 80°C) is comfortably above your calculated RMS current. For example, for a 30A RMS load, a module rated for 50A like the <a href="#">GD50HFL120C1S</a> provides a good safety margin.</p>

                <h2>Step 2: Consider Switching Frequency and Losses</h2>
