                <p class="lead">An IGBT module failure can be a costly and time-consuming event. Understanding the root cause is essential to prevent future occurrences. This guide covers the most common failure modes our FAEs encounter and how to diagnose them.</p>

                <h2>Failure Mode 1: Short-Circuit / Overcurrent</h2>
                <p>This is one of the most destructive failure modes. It occurs when the IGBT is forced to conduct a current far beyond its rated maximum, often due to a load short-circuit or a shoot-through event in a half-bridge.</p>
                <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Catastrophic failure with visible damage to the module casing (cracks, burn marks).</li>
                    <li>Internal bond wires fused or lifted.</li>
                    <li>Shorted collector-emitter junction.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Prevention:</h3>
                <p>Ensure your gate driver has a fast-acting desaturation (DESAT) protection circuit that can turn off the IGBT within the specified Short-Circuit Withstand Time (typically 5-10Âµs).</p>

                <h2>Failure Mode 2: Overvoltage</h2>
                <p>This occurs when the voltage across the collector-emitter (Vce) exceeds the module's breakdown voltage rating (Vces). This is often caused by stray inductance in the DC-link busbar during high di/dt switching events.</p>
                <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Punctured die, often with no external signs of damage.</li>
                    <li>Increased collector-emitter leakage current.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Prevention:</h3>
                <p>Minimize the inductance in your DC bus layout using laminated busbars. Use high-quality, low-ESL DC-link capacitors and consider adding a snubber circuit if voltage overshoot is still an issue.</p>
