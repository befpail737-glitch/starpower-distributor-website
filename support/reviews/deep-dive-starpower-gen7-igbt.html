                <p class="lead">Starpower recently launched its 7th Generation (G7) of IGBTs, promising significant performance gains over the previous generation. As a key <strong>Starpower distributor</strong>, we've had a chance to evaluate these new devices. This review breaks down the key technological advancements and what they mean for your next power electronics design.</p>

                <h2>Key Advancement 1: Lower VCE(sat)</h2>
                <p>The most notable improvement in the G7 series is the reduction in the collector-emitter saturation voltage (VCE(sat)). By leveraging a new micro-pattern trench gate structure, Starpower has managed to lower VCE(sat) by approximately 0.2V at the same current rating compared to the G6 series. This directly translates to lower conduction losses, which is especially critical in applications like motor drives and solar inverters.</p>
                
                <h2>Key Advancement 2: Higher Maximum Junction Temperature (Tj,max)</h2>
                <p>The maximum operating junction temperature has been increased from 150°C to 175°C. This 25°C increase provides two major benefits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Increased Power Output:</strong> For a given heatsink and cooling system, you can now push more current through the module, increasing the power output of your inverter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Reliability:</strong> Operating the device further from its absolute maximum limit provides a larger safety margin, increasing the lifetime and reliability of the end product.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Real-World Impact: What This Means for Engineers</h2>
                <p>For an engineer designing a 50kW industrial inverter, switching to a G7 IGBT could result in a 10-15% reduction in total power losses. This could mean the difference between using a standard aluminum heatsink versus a more expensive copper one, or it could allow for a fanless design in a lower-power application. The benefits are tangible and directly impact system cost, size, and reliability.</p>
