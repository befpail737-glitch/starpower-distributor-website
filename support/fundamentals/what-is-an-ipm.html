                <p class="lead">In power electronics, you'll often encounter two types of modules: standard IGBT modules and Intelligent Power Modules (IPMs). While they may look similar, their internal functionality is very different. This guide explains what an IPM is and helps you decide if it's right for your design.</p>
                <h2>What is an Intelligent Power Module (IPM)?</h2>
                <p>An IPM is a power module that integrates the power switching devices (IGBTs) with their dedicated gate drive circuits. In addition to the drivers, most IPMs also include a suite of protection circuits, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO)</li>
                    <li>Over-Current Protection (OCP)</li>
                    <li>Over-Temperature Protection (OTP)</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>IPM vs. Standard IGBT Module + External Driver</h2>
                <h3>Advantages of an IPM:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Simplified Design & Faster Time-to-Market:</strong> The most complex part of the design—the gate driver—is already done for you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Higher Reliability:</strong> The integrated driver is perfectly matched to the IGBTs, and built-in protections prevent damage from common fault conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compact Size:</strong> Integrating multiple functions onto a single substrate saves significant PCB space.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>When to Use a Standard IGBT Module:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High Power Levels:</strong> For very high-power applications (hundreds or thousands of amps), discrete modules offer more flexibility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Custom Gate Drive Requirements:</strong> When you need precise control over switching speed (dV/dt, di/dt) for EMI or other specific reasons.</li>
                </ul>
