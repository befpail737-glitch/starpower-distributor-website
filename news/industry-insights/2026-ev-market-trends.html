                <p class="lead">The electric vehicle market continues to evolve at a rapid pace. For power electronics engineers, staying ahead of the curve is essential. Here are three major trends in power semiconductors that will define the next generation of EVs.</p>
                <h2>1. The Mainstream Adoption of 800V Architectures</h2>
                <p>While 400V systems are still common, the industry is rapidly shifting to 800V battery architectures. This allows for ultra-fast charging (up to 350kW) and reduces the current required for the same power output, allowing for lighter and cheaper vehicle wiring.</p>
                <h2>2. Silicon Carbide (SiC) Becomes the Standard</h2>
                <p>For the main traction inverter, SiC is replacing silicon IGBTs as the technology of choice. The higher efficiency of SiC directly translates to increased vehicle range—the most critical metric for consumers. Starpower's automotive-grade SiC modules are at the forefront of this transition.</p>
                <h2>3. Increased Integration in Power Modules</h2>
                <p>OEMs are demanding more compact and reliable power electronics. This is driving the integration of more components—like sensors, drivers, and capacitors—directly into the power module package, simplifying assembly and improving performance.</p>
