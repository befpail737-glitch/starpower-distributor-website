## Development Workflow

This is a static HTML/CSS/JS website. No complex build framework is required.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone [your-repo-url]`
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd starpower-distributor-website`
3.  Install development dependencies for minification: `npm install`

### Making Changes

1.  Edit the source files located in `/css/style.css` and `/js/main.js`.
2.  Do **not** edit the `.min.css` or `.min.js` files directly.
3.  Once your changes are complete, run the build script to minify the assets:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
4.  Commit the changes to both the source files and the minified files to Git.

## Deployment

This website is designed for deployment on **Cloudflare Pages**.

1.  Connect this GitHub repository to a new Cloudflare Pages project.
2.  **Framework Preset:** `None`
3.  **Build Command:** (Leave Blank)
4.  **Output Directory:** (Leave Blank)
5.  Deploy from the `main` branch.

The `_redirects` file in the root directory will automatically handle clean URLs and the custom 404 page. The `contact-form-handler` Cloudflare Worker must be deployed separately and its URL configured in `contact.html` and `js/main.js`.
